# Migrating to new releases of Pathway Commons

The file `src/server/graph-generation/generic-physical-entities/generic-physical-entity-map.json` 
needs to be updated with every PC release.

## Steps to generic-physical-entity-map.json

1. download the latest physical_entities.json.gz file from `http://www.pathwaycommons.org/archives/PC2/v10/`
2. filter out non-generic entities before mapping: 
e.g. 
```sh
zgrep '"generic":true' physical_entities.json.gz > generic_physical_entities.json
```
3. run the script to process the filtered file (results in ~3mb mapping file):
```sh
node src/scripts/generic-entity-mapping/generic-physical-entity-map.js
```
4. replace `src/server/graph-generation/generic-phyiscal-entities/generic-phyiscal-entity-map.json` 
with the new file generated by the script and commit it
